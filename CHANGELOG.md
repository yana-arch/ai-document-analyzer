# Changelog

All notable changes to AI Document Analyzer will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [2.4.0] - 2025-10-21

### ‚ú® Added

- **Integrated History**: Unified history for both document analyses and CV interviews, allowing users to view and reload past sessions from a single, filterable list.
- **Complete Translation Coverage**: Added comprehensive English and Vietnamese translations for all Hub, Overview, and Breadcrumb components.

### üîÑ Changed

- **Speech-to-Text UX**: Enhanced the speech-to-text experience with a live transcript preview, a clearer "listening" indicator, and better error handling.
- **History System**: Refactored the history management logic to support multiple types of history items (documents and interviews) in a type-safe manner.
- **UI Consolidation**: Removed the separate, isolated interview history page in favor of the new integrated history list.

### üêõ Fixed

- **Interview Timer**: Corrected a bug where the interview timer could cause an infinite evaluation loop if the user did not submit their answer. The timer now correctly auto-submits the current answer when time expires.
- **Infinite Loop in PracticeStateManager**: Fixed infinite re-rendering issue in `usePracticeSettingsHandler` hook by stabilizing dependency arrays and preventing unnecessary updates.
- **JSON Parsing Errors**: Added robust error handling for corrupted localStorage data with graceful recovery and data validation.
- **Translation System**: Updated LearningHub and InterviewResults components to use proper translation keys instead of hardcoded text.

## [2.3.0] - 2025-10-15

### ‚ú® Added

- **Speech-to-Text Input**: Introduced speech-to-text capability, allowing users to speak their answers in interview and practice sessions.
  - Implemented a reusable `useSpeechRecognition` hook for browser Web Speech API integration.
  - Integrated microphone input and real-time transcription into `InterviewSession.tsx` and `PreparationStep.tsx`.
  - Added necessary TypeScript declarations for Web Speech API types to ensure type safety.

## [2.2.0] - 2025-10-15

### ‚ö°Ô∏è Performance Optimizations

- **Optimized Initial Load Time**: Refactored module loading for core features to significantly improve the initial application load time.
- **Implemented Code Splitting**:
  - Applied lazy loading to `CVUploader` and `DocumentUploader` components, deferring the loading of heavy document-processing libraries until they are needed.
  - Resolved a mixed static/dynamic import issue for the core `aiService`, allowing it to be split into a separate chunk.
- **Reduced Bundle Size**: These changes reduce the initial JavaScript payload, leading to a faster Time-to-Interactive for all users.

## [2.1.0] - 2025-10-15

### ‚ú® Added

- **CV Interview Practice Feature**: Allows users to upload their CV, specify a target job position, and practice for a job interview with AI-generated questions.
- **AI-Powered Exercise Grading**: Introduces an `ExerciseGrader` component to automatically grade user-submitted exercises.
- **Document Tips Refresh**: Implemented a manual refresh for document tips and enhanced settings management for tips.
- **Enhanced Conversation Threading**: (Moved from upcoming)
- **Advanced Code Execution with Syntax Highlighting**: (Moved from upcoming)
- **Custom AI Model Selection**: (Moved from upcoming)
- **Advanced File Comparison Tools**: (Moved from upcoming)
- **Collaboration Features**: (Moved from upcoming)
